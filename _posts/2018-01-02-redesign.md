title: Use Travis to automate your custom Jekyll deployment
---

I updated my page to use a [new theme]() and a Jekyll plugin to [list publications]().
Unfortunately, Github pages allows only a handful of plugins, so I couldn't run automatic deployment.

Travis ftw: [This tutorial](http://eshepelyuk.github.io/2014/10/28/automate-github-pages-travisci.html) explains how to set up travis, so you can enjoy automatic deployment via commit hooks.

Nota Bene: If you run a user profile page (`username.github.io`), you can only serve from the `master` branch; this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28252200) has a convenient walk-through to fix this.
