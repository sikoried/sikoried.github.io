I'm a full professor of computer science at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/) where I teach software architecture and machine learning.

I'm also co-founder of [Remeeting](https://remeeting.com/), a service to transcribe and search spoken audio such as teleconferences or phone calls.

My research is focused on speech recognition and understanding (find me on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=__qMXKgAAAAJ&hl=en)).
Every now and then I get to contribute to [kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) and [jstk](https://github.com/sikoried/jstk).

I also enjoy flying single engine airplanes such as [C152](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_152), [C162](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_162) [C172](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172) or [C182](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_182).
I got my ticket in 2010, added an instrument rating in 2013 and hold endorsements for high-performance and complex aircraft.
I'm currently working towards a commercial license.

When I'm not working or flying, you may find me playing the violin.
I enjoy both orchestra and chamber music, and perform every now and then.
