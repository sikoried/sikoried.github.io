<h3 id="softa">Software Architecture <a href="#list"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

A deep dive into object oriented programming using the Java language, with a focus on design patterns.
We also touch multi-threading and basics of functional programming.

The class is taught in German, with English materials.
See the [course website](http://ohm-softa.github.io).


<h3 id="sequence-learning">Sequence Learning <a href="#list"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

This class focuses on the particular problem of classifying _sequences_ of observations, as opposed to single observations.
We begin with simple techniques such as dynamic timewarping, and dive deeper into hidden Markov models and recurrent (deep) neural networks.
Applications include stock market prediction, speech recognition or speech translation.

<h3 id="wt">Web Technologies <a href="#list"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

A round-house kick introduction to how web apps work: starting with the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, we'll explore [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) as an advanced toolkit, and conclude with deployment using [docker](https://docker.com) and [heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

The class is taught in German, with English materials.
